description: In light of recent events, there is a need to adjust the amount of music that gets represented in vocal recitals. This is a list of vocal works by Black composers. These are merely my own findings (endless google searches) and this list can only grow—please contact me if I am missing more obvious repertoire!

Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BuFN9GR0oU" target="_blank"><i>L'autre jour a l'ombrage</i></a> (the YouTube title is misleading: the piece is by Bologne and not by Patrice Michaels—this is the singer). </li> <br><br>

  More of a book kind of person? This <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anthology-Songs-Black-American-Composers/dp/0793508711" target="_blank">anthology for voice and piano</a> is pretty neat!<br><br>

  Go on, you know what to do...here are even more names:<br>
  - Wendell Logan (one of his pieces is listed in the MIT website linked above) <br>
  - Mark Fax<br>
  - Hale Smith<br>
  - Noel da Costa<br>
  - Olly Wilson<br>
  - Howard Swanson<br>
  <i>I got the above names from <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zasUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=wendell+logan+vocal+works&source=bl&ots=ZGbBDv1NWK&sig=ACfU3U0y3a7VAUs9-vDLWrGF5q3df7OLOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj39e7klMjqAhXNVhUIHWqWAfkQ6AEwB3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=Mark%20Fax&f=false" target="_blank">this book</a>.</i><br><br>

  I've filtered the search to only include classical-type vocal works. But I need to mention all the existent jazz repertoire by composers such as Duke Ellignton! That's a whole different list right there!<br><br>

  Thanks for all the people that contacted me to add more names! <br>Did I miss anyone? Let me know by emailing me at: tannazaremusic@gmail.com <br><br>
